<meta name="description" content="Digital Painting - Farm HouseDigital Painting - Farm House from the movie Interstellar.This iconic photo from the movie Interstellar captures the farmhouse that sits in the middle of a cornfield set in the not so distant future. A future where we humans have exhausted most of the natural resources, turning our planet to mere dust.I recently watched this documentary called &#39;One Strange Rock&#39; hosted by Will Smith that explores a larger perspective of the earth through the eyes of 10 astronauts who have spent a total of more than 1000 days in space. It&#39;s an incredibly delightful docuseries I&#39;ve come across in 2019. I&#39;d recommend for anyone who wants to sit back and get bewildered by the wonders of the cosmos both on a microscopic &amp; a macroscopic level.Peggy Whitson&#39;s story featured in the last episode of the documentary really got my admiration. She was born in the 60s and grew upon on a farm outside of the town of Beaconsfield, Iowa. She had spent most of her childhood, and early young age on the farm. Who had known at that time this young girl from a town in Iowa would become the person with a record of the highest time spent in space - a total 0f 665 days. Not only that, she holds the highest number of spacewalks, and several other records. It reminded me of the &#39;Murph&#39; character from the movie Interstellar.&nbsp;Being associated with farming, and taking a step towards space exploration I think is quite a remarkable mission. Having spent your life taking from the earth, and having that as your main source of income, and then looking at the cosmos to foresee that the planet earth from which we came from will no longer be able to sustain human life after a point. And to having work towards finding/building a new home, is not a mission of a generation or two. It is the longest project that the human species will ever pursue." />
