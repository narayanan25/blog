<meta name="description" content="It was around 11 in the morning , just woke up from bed . I wanted to do a painting with a composition that has very strong lighting . I found this pot in the outdoor corner of my house . Its actually an hanging pot that is almost touching the ground . Liked the way it was partly lit by sunlight and hoped it would bring out realism in the painting . Took a bunch of snaps and imported it in the &#39;Brushes&#39; app on the iPad . Traced out a rough outline as a reference and started painting the rest . It was a rewarding experience after a very long time . Finally , imported the painting into Adobe PS in iPad , applied a vignette and color corrected just a pinch .&nbsp;" />
