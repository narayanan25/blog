When we are lost in the musing of our perplexed mind , is it words that&#39;s rambling or just thoughts that is yearning to be identified as a word . To express the thought with resolute authenticity is to kill the structure of the language .

Yes it is vile to criticize words with words , how else could one proliferate the qualities of art without words , with art ?? To do that is like explaining a sign board with another sign board . That is where words find their essentiality . One cannot neglect the other , for none can survive without the other (strokes and words) .So far in life I have been day dreaming most of the time . On a blue moon I express them on a canvas(digital) . Now that I have started loving words , I get the fun in defining stuffs with clarity and a structure . To express in a contrived manner with words in their grammar is as joyful as to express on a canvas with insane amount of freedom . In such scenarios , freedom and restrain mean the same .That is where the words transcend their individual meaning to define a vague expression , thus losing their structure but winning their purpose . I feel that there is an artist in every writer and a writer in every artist . Treating words as arts and arts as words transcends their boundaries and reach ultimate expression .
