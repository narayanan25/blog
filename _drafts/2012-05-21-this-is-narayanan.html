<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This is Narayan ,<br />A day dreamer , that's how I see myself . I spent my time &nbsp;in college like everyone else in movies , videogames and music, yes a lot of highs as well , in mundane I do some art . Sketches ,photoshop ,motion graphics ,photography ,scribbling .At this point of life I feel like I am wandering &nbsp;around a like a zombie without purpose or will . Whats life worth is what you make of it ? Right ? I dont have the zest I had a couple of years ago . What are we doing in this planet ? Aren't we as significant as we thought we were . Are we just the speckles of dust amidst a storm ? Or are we the magnanimous body where &nbsp;billions of cells live ? Why am I trying to find who I am ? Its the paradox I have been running over and over again . Me looking for me by me . Now there is an infinite loop which whiles away my time .<br />At a point I am too tired trying to find answers for the questions that arise . <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Reading a person's blog inspired me to post out my thoughts, insights and the stories I had been burying in my notes till now .Thank you .</span><br /><br /><br /><br />These words keep me dreaming ....<br />soul ,teleportation ,god ,AI ,art ,palette knife ,watercolor ,god ,dualism ,ghost, multi dimensions ,string theory, vfx ,cinematography ,lamborghini, street customs ,hypnosis, psychology ,ego ,psychedelics ,mind benders, taboos ,meditation, god particle ,anti matter, time warp ,time lapse ,script writing , compositing ,photography ,guitar, basketball, street ball, wolverine ,inception ,dreams , big crunch , ID ,list goes on .......... </div>
