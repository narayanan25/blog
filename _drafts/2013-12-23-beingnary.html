<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">How does it feel like being Nary ?<br /><br />Below is a pulp of my confused mind . Warning : Seek no answers but questions .<br /><br />Hello , fellow wanderers . Yes , I see life that way .We are all wandering , right ? What else ? The nearer we get to understanding life , the farther we move from reality . Life can't be understood like some process that we have been taught in classrooms . Its not that simple .What is life ?An abstract question , There is no single answer to it , is there?? Sometimes I feel like it would have been easier if life was as simple as a 2 mark question . Look at how education has ruined my thought process . Yet its education that has given me material to mould my thoughts .<br />What are we living for ? Whats the whole point in living when we are gonna die some day ? Everyone is gonna die , the point is to have a good time until dead , really ? Why did I even start writing this post ?When I started this blog ,I wanted to specifically post only arts . Now this is kinda changing from the blog being about my arts to about me .So why change ? Because I read the whole blog of my college crush a few days back . I was very interested in that person the whole time and am still interested . But I know very little of her . I always wanted to know whats running in her mind . What is she like ? What kinda person she is ? Does she think crazily stupid stuffs like me ?So coming to know that she writes a blog is like the best accidental present ever . I didn't enjoy reading anything else so much . Be it a philosophical concept or a scientific explanation or a psychological revelation .... Nothing can be as good as reading her blog . Reading her writing is like connecting a bunch of wires to her head and downloading gigabytes of thoughts to mine .I usually tend to look at the backstage of any word I listen or any action I see &nbsp;. There is so much that the ego and superego deceives the ears and eyes of the lay observer. I look at the string and not the beads . So reading a bunch of post from her blog was like getting along with for a couple of days . This actually gave me an idea for a screenplay . Where the protagonist breaks-up with his girlfriend , after which his girlfriend starts writing a blog with short stories . When the protagonist accidentally finds this , he correlates the stories in her blog with the incidents in his life and understands the &nbsp;roots of the story . He in turn writes stories telling his views through that . His girlfriend now understands this , and an argument starts to evolve in the manner of stories they post . Thats the idea of the screenplay I got after experiencing the joy of reading a blog of someone I wish to be with . Usually be it a post , movie , music , activity or whatever .....even life, there has to be a purpose or reason behind it . But I don't know the purpose of this post . Again , there could be a scientific or a philosophical or a psychological reason to it .May be ....no definitely I was inspired by my crush's writing . And I spend 9 hours a day in the workplace where I feel like I am a zombie , giving me enough anxiety to feed my thoughts .Plus I am so confused that I started writing something which turned into a story in the middle and became a lame post in my blog . I am not a pen person , but I write a lots of bits and pieces . Probably this is one of the lengthiest . What is the point of this post ?(I know I have to stop it) Don't know for sure . Maybe its helping someone , maybe its pissing someone &nbsp;, maybe someone realises its not just me who is stupid and crazy , ....I don't know ..... That's what life is ..... No one knows its purpose ....should there be one? Why should life have purpose ? I don't want to assume that its got one answer to it and that's the right one . Its really tough for me put a single statement about life , coz its very complex and just one quote or a proverb wouldn't say it all .<br /><br />Please leave your views , thoughts and comments . I appreciate crazy and stupid stuffs .&nbsp;</div>
